# BetterMessengerTT (BMTT)
BMTT (Work In Progress) is a dumb add-on which essentially is Twitch chat right into your Messenger chat. 

Bugs can still happen and I'm not responsible for Chrome crashing (shouldn't be happening but haven't tested it yet).

Messenger version SHOULD work flawlessly and we're currently in a beta for the Facebook version.

Facebook version should run better for now!

## How to install on Chrome
It got released on Chrome store! Only the Messenger version works there.
1. Install on [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bettermessengertt/gmllkmdhcbencpjnppfipjjajcbbbpgk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bettermessengertt/gmllkmdhcbencpjnppfipjjajcbbbpgk)

To install the 'beta' Facebook version do this:
1. Download the repo as a ZIP and unzip it somewhere you like
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Enable 'Developer mode' on the right upper corner
4. 'Load Unpacked' and select the whole folder you just downloaded.
5. Open and reload your Messenger window
6. Voila, it should be working!



## How to Install on Firefox
Not yet released. 


## TODO: 
1. Being able to change emotes in messages ("hey KEKW"), this is done with "html.replace(/usedEmote/g)" but can't use variables at the moment
2. Firefox implementation



All emotes go to their respective creators and owners. 

## Currently supported emotes
The thousand first emotes of https://betterttv.com/emotes/top.
