# BetterMessengerTT (BMTT)
BMTT (Work In Progress) is a dumb add-on which essentially is Twitch chat right into your Messenger chat. 

Bugs can still happen and I'm not responsible for Chrome crashing (shouldn't be happening but haven't tested it yet).

Messenger version SHOULD work flawlessly and we're currently in a beta for the Facebook version.

As things stand it works like this:
Load your Facebook and open up a chat window.
After 7 seconds of opening your window, whenever something happens in the chat window (hover, new message, ...) it should convert any emotes to the images.
BUT when you close the window in order to make the images work again you have to reload your whole page. To prevent this, don't close your window but change
chat screens without closing them, then it keeps working.

I am currently looking for a fix.
