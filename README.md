# BetterMessengerTT (BMTT)
BMTT (Work In Progress) is a dumb add-on which essentially is Twitch chat right into your Messenger chat. 

Bugs can still happen and I'm not responsible for Chrome crashing (shouldn't be happening but haven't tested it yet).

Messenger version SHOULD work flawlessly and we're currently in a beta for the Facebook version.

Facebook version should run better for now!

I am currently looking for a fix.
